xxmaj he 's in this movie somewhere , but we only know what the movie tells us . xxmaj this is by far the film 's biggest flaw . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is n't so much a character but a xxunk - xxunk ball , xxunk between scenes with xxmaj judy and his xxmaj grandmother , but we never get to know who xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas really is . xxmaj this is important because as xxmaj i 've mentioned the only thing we know of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is that he 's a sexually active teenager with a xxunk the size of xxmaj manhattan . xxmaj he 's a total xxmaj xxunk - male . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is not the kind of character i sympathize with at all . xxmaj why should anyone ? xxmaj so by the end of the movie , in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas has attained xxup any depth and learned the errors of his ways ? xxmaj how could such a two - dimensional character have any depth ? xxmaj if only the director had worried a little more about xxunk out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect hand - held shot . \\n\\n xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas brings to life the world of the xxmaj latino inner - city neighborhood to the big screen . xxmaj something that few films have done before in the past . xxmaj the film has been xxunk for feeling so real , and i wo n't \\n\\n argue with that . i have n't seen this level of reality since xxup xxunk aired xxmaj survivor . xxmaj seriously , although the movie has some nice shots of the city , the writer / director xxmaj peter xxmaj sollett was way too xxunk on close - ups and hand - held shots . xxmaj this problem is particularly noticed in xxunk scenes that are so claustrophobic i was forced to perform deep - breathing xxunk to keep from passing out . xxmaj as the film continues , the shots get tighter and tighter with faces xxunk from xxunk to xxunk on the screen ; you can practically xxunk xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas 's cheap xxunk . xxmaj the overall effect is unrealistic in contrast . xxmaj the xxunk scenes of inner - city apartments make them look small and xxunk , which is not true . xxmaj i 've been in those type apartments ; i used to live in one . xxmaj they 're not xxunk but they have high xxunk and they 're decent living xxunk . xxmaj by the movie 's standards you 'd think that these apartments were xxunk xxunk of xxunk - and - xxunk , xxunk paint and xxunk walls . xxmaj unfortunately , xxmaj sollett 's constant use of close - ups and one particularly bad shot with a xxunk - in on one scene come off as totally amateurish . xxmaj but xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is only xxmaj sollett 's second film , and his most well known , a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films . xxmaj one review i read xxunk the movie as , ` ethnicity for xxmaj ethnicity 's xxmaj sake , ' and i can not agree more . xxmaj if xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas were truly a great film and story , then the characters ' xxunk would n't matter whether they were xxmaj latino , xxmaj chinese , etc . xxmaj yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middle - class xxunk with a bunch of xxunk - xxunk white kids the results would n't be such glowing reviews , and we 'd see the film 's flaws more clearly . xxmaj indeed , some other aspects of the use of xxmaj latinos in this film bother me . xxmaj while some aspects of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas are accurate others i have to question . xxmaj for example , xxmaj victor , xxmaj nino and xxmaj vicky all share the same room to sleep . xxmaj this set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what i believe . xxmaj any self - xxunk xxmaj latino family would n't have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteen - year old girl . xxmaj at first i was xxunk , perhaps i was wrong , but after speaking with my grandmother i knew my problem with this was justified . xxmaj considering how conservative the grandmother is , you 'd think that xxmaj vicky would have been sleeping in her room . \\n\\n xxmaj as a xxmaj latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative xxmaj cuban household , raised by my grandmother while my mother was working full - time , i could relate to the movie in many ways , which is why my critical xxunk are xxunk because i really wanted to love this movie . xxmaj unfortunately , my lack of respect for xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas xxunk my feelings for the film . xxmaj maybe it 's because xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while i was playing with my xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk when i was xxunk . xxmaj maybe it 's because without any further xxunk by the film , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is merely a stereotypical hot - blooded xxmaj latino , who 'll just end up shouting to girls from his car , ` hey bay - xxunk , xxunk want to get into my xxunk xxunk - xxunk ? ' xxmaj either way i do n't like him , so ultimately how can i like a film about him ? xxmaj so if you 'll excuse me , xxmaj i 'm going to go stick my hands into a bowl of xxunk .</td>\n",

       "      <td>xxbos xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner is one of the xxunk and most feel - good romantic comedies ever made . xxmaj there 's just no getting around that , and it 's hard to actually put one 's feeling for this film into words . xxmaj it 's not one of those films that tries too hard , nor does it come up with the xxunk possible scenarios to get the two protagonists together in the end . xxmaj in fact , all its charm is xxunk , contained within the characters and the setting and the plot … which is highly believable to xxunk . xxmaj it 's easy to think that such a love story , as beautiful as any other ever told , * could * happen to you … a feeling you do n't often get from other romantic comedies , however sweet and heart - warming they may be . \\n\\n xxmaj alfred xxmaj kralik ( james xxmaj stewart ) and xxmaj clara xxmaj xxunk ( margaret xxmaj xxunk ) do n't have the most xxunk of first xxunk when she arrives in the shop ( matuschek &amp; xxmaj co. ) he 's been working in for the past nine years , asking for a job . xxmaj they clash from the very beginning , mostly over a cigarette box that plays music when it 's opened -- he thinks it 's a ludicrous idea ; she makes one big sell of it and gets hired . xxmaj their bickering takes them through the next six months , even as they both ( xxunk , of course ! ) fall in love with each other when they share their souls and minds in letters passed through xxup xxunk xxmaj box xxunk . xxmaj this would be a pretty thin xxunk to base an entire film on , except that xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner is xxunk xxunk - out with a brilliant supporting cast made up of entirely engaging characters , from the xxunk but lonely xxmaj hugo xxmaj matuschek ( frank xxmaj morgan ) himself , who learns that his shop really is his home ; xxmaj xxunk ( felix xxmaj xxunk ) , xxmaj kralik 's sidekick and friend who always xxunk out of the room when faced with the possibility of being asked for his honest opinion ; xxunk pimp - du - xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( joseph xxmaj xxunk ) who ultimately gets his comeuppance from a xxunk righteous xxmaj kralik ; and ambitious xxunk boy xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( william xxmaj tracy ) who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of xxunk for xxmaj matuschek &amp; xxmaj co. xxmaj the xxunk love story between ' dear xxmaj friends ' is played out in this little shop in xxmaj budapest , xxmaj hungary , in which xxmaj kralik 's xxunk xxunk and subsequent xxunk to shop manager help the two xxunk - to - be along . xxmaj it 's nice that everyone gets a story in this film ; the supporting characters are well - developed , and xxmaj matuschek 's own journey in life is almost as touching as the one xxmaj alfred and xxmaj clara share . xxmaj his xxunk to new xxunk boy xxmaj xxunk ( charles xxmaj smith ) for xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve dinner , made in the xxunk , beautiful snow of a xxmaj hungarian winter , makes the audience glad that he is not alone ; we come to care even for the characters whose love story it is n't this film 's business to tell . \\n\\n xxmaj aside from the love story , i must say that xxmaj james xxmaj stewart is truly one of the best things about this film . xxmaj he does n't play the full - xxunk xxmaj jimmy xxmaj stewart persona in this film ( c / f ' mr xxmaj smith xxmaj goes xxmaj to xxmaj washington ' for that ) ; in fact xxmaj alfred xxmaj kralik is xxunk and abrupt and not particularly kind . xxmaj he 's rather a xxunk man , in fact , with little hint ( until , perhaps , the very end ) of the xxunk - xxunk down - home xxunk charm xxmaj stewart would soon come to xxunk . xxmaj when he finds out before xxmaj clara that they have been xxunk in secret , in fact , xxmaj kralik does n't ' xxunk up -- he xxunk it out to see how far he can take the xxunk , especially since he quickly realises ( given his stormy relationship with xxmaj clara as boss and xxunk ) that loving the person he knows through the xxunk letters might not xxunk with loving the person herself . xxmaj his description to xxmaj clara of the fictional xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ( what a name ! ) who was to become her xxunk is hilarious in the extreme , but also his way of proving that the letters do n't reveal all there is to a man , just as her letters do n't reveal all there is to her . xxmaj stewart plays this role perfectly -- he keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever xxmaj clara insults xxmaj mr . xxmaj kralik , as she is often wo nt to do , even ( and especially ) to his face . xxmaj and yet one believes , underneath the xxunk and xxunk , that he * could * reveal his identity with as much xxunk and xxunk and sheer * hope * as he eventually does . \\n\\n xxmaj special mention must be given to the other members of the cast as well . xxmaj margaret xxmaj xxunk xxunk rather less well in the first half of the film , but she really comes into her own in the closing - shop scene on xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve , when she almost gets her heart broken again by xxmaj alfred 's most vivid description of her xxunk xxunk . xxmaj frank xxmaj morgan turns in a great performance as the jealous xxmaj hugo xxmaj matuschek driven to nervous breakdown , the man who has to xxunk his meaning in life when he realises that his wife of 22 years does not want to ' grow old with him ' . xxmaj and xxmaj felix xxmaj xxunk plays the role of the meek but xxunk xxmaj xxunk wonderfully ( a xxmaj lubitsch regular , since he appears as a hilarious xxmaj russian xxunk in xxunk particular note is the scene in which he helps his good friend xxmaj alfred get the xxmaj christmas present the latter * really * wants … a wallet instead of that ludicrous cigarette box xxmaj clara is so hung up on . \\n\\n xxmaj xxunk xxmaj lubitsch really does himself proud with this film -- for example , the famously xxunk and xxunk care given to detail in the creation of the xxmaj matuschek shop is well worth the effort , right down to the xxmaj hungarian names on the door , the xxunk and the cash xxunk and so on . xxmaj but even though xxmaj lubitsch chose to have the story set in xxmaj hungary , the setting is actually universal : it could happen anywhere ; it could happen to you . xxmaj xxunk lies the charm of this simple story , these believable characters who really * are * people . xxmaj the snow on xxmaj christmas xxmaj eve is real as well , or at least as real as xxmaj lubitsch could make it ( he had snow machines brought in at great expense ) . xxmaj it is this desire to make everything appear as real as possible that helps make the story even more believable , that gives this entire film a dreamy realism that can not be xxunk . ( no , not even in a remake like xxup you 've xxup got xxup mail . ) \\n\\n * this * is really the xxmaj jimmy xxmaj stewart xxmaj christmas film that people are missing out on when they talk about xxup it 's a xxup wonderful xxup life . xxmaj not to xxunk from the merits of that other film , but there 'd be no harm , and in fact a lot of good , done in watching xxup the xxup shop xxup around xxup the xxup corner this xxmaj christmas instead . xxmaj it 's sweet , funny , charming , and xxmaj stewart is xxunk in his role . xxmaj we should all be so lucky as to have the romance depicted in this film ; the best thing about this film is that we come away from it feeling that we very possibly could .</td>\n",
