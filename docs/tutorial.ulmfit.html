      <td>xxbos xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas : a xxmaj review \n\n xxmaj you know , xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is like sticking your hands into a big , xxunk bowl of xxunk . xxmaj it 's warm and gooey , but you 're not sure if it feels right . xxmaj try as i might , no matter how warm and gooey xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas became i was always aware that something did n't quite feel right . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas suffers from a certain xxunk on the director 's part . xxmaj apparently , the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a xxmaj latino family on the lower east side , and an xxunk storyline would make the film critic proof . xxmaj he was right , but it did n't fool me . xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is the story about a xxunk - year old boy called , you guessed it , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas ( victor xxmaj xxunk ) who lives his teenage years chasing more xxunk than the xxmaj rolling xxmaj xxunk could do in all the years they 've xxunk . xxmaj the movie starts off in ` ugly xxmaj fat ' xxmaj donna 's bedroom where xxmaj victor is sure to seduce her , but a cry from outside xxunk his plans when his best - friend xxmaj harold ( kevin xxmaj xxunk ) comes - a - looking for him . xxmaj caught in the attempt by xxmaj harold and his sister , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas runs off for xxunk control . xxmaj yet even with the embarrassing implication that he 's been xxunk the xxunk girl in the neighborhood , nothing xxunk young xxmaj victor from going off on the hunt for more fresh meat . xxmaj on a hot , xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj city day they make way to the local public swimming pool where xxmaj victor 's eyes catch a glimpse of the lovely young xxunk xxmaj judy ( judy xxmaj xxunk ) , who 's not just pretty , but a strong and independent too . xxmaj the relationship that develops between xxmaj victor and xxmaj judy becomes the focus of the film . xxmaj the story also focuses on xxmaj victor 's family that is comprised of his grandmother or xxunk ( xxunk xxmaj guzman ) , his brother xxmaj nino ( also played by real life brother to xxmaj victor , xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) and his sister xxmaj vicky ( xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) . xxmaj the action follows xxmaj victor between scenes with xxmaj judy and scenes with his family . xxmaj victor tries to xxunk with being an oversexed pimp - daddy , his feelings for xxmaj judy and his grandmother 's conservative xxmaj catholic upbringing . \n\n xxmaj the problems that xxunk from xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas are a few , but glaring errors . xxmaj throughout the film you get to know certain characters like xxmaj vicky , xxmaj nino , xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj judy and even xxmaj judy 's best friend xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj the problem is , we know nothing of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas except that he is the biggest gigolo in the neighborhood . xxmaj we know that he knows how to lick his lips , and xxunk his xxunk , and carry himself for the sake of xxunk girls into the xxunk , but that 's all . xxmaj we know that xxmaj nino plays piano , and quiet well , you could see it by the awards on the family piano . xxmaj we know his sister xxmaj xxunk , is a gossip - loving girl with an xxunk interest in watching xxup tv . xxmaj we know that xxunk is a hard - working traditional xxmaj xxunk woman who 's trying to raise her kids with xxunk in a world of excess corruption . xxmaj yet where is the titular character , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas ? xxmaj he 's in this movie somewhere , but we only know what the movie tells us . xxmaj this is by far the film 's biggest flaw . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is n't so much a character but a xxunk - xxunk ball , xxunk between scenes with xxmaj judy and his xxmaj grandmother , but we never get to know who xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas really is . xxmaj this is important because as xxmaj i 've mentioned the only thing we know of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is that he 's a sexually active teenager with a xxunk the size of xxmaj manhattan . xxmaj he 's a total xxmaj xxunk - male . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is not the kind of character i sympathize with at all . xxmaj why should anyone ? xxmaj so by the end of the movie , in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas has attained xxup any depth and learned the errors of his ways ? xxmaj how could such a two - dimensional character have any depth ? xxmaj if only the director had worried a little more about xxunk out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect hand - held shot . \n\n xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas brings to life the world of the xxmaj latino inner - city neighborhood to the big screen . xxmaj something that few films have done before in the past . xxmaj the film has been xxunk for feeling so real , and i wo n't \n\n argue with that . i have n't seen this level of reality since xxup xxunk aired xxmaj survivor . xxmaj seriously , although the movie has some nice shots of the city , the writer / director xxmaj peter xxmaj sollett was way too xxunk on close - ups and hand - held shots . xxmaj this problem is particularly noticed in xxunk scenes that are so claustrophobic i was forced to perform deep - breathing xxunk to keep from passing out . xxmaj as the film continues , the shots get tighter and tighter with faces xxunk from xxunk to xxunk on the screen ; you can practically xxunk xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas 's cheap xxunk . xxmaj the overall effect is unrealistic in contrast . xxmaj the xxunk scenes of inner - city apartments make them look small and xxunk , which is not true . xxmaj i 've been in those type apartments ; i used to live in one . xxmaj they 're not xxunk but they have high xxunk and they 're decent living xxunk . xxmaj by the movie 's standards you 'd think that these apartments were xxunk xxunk of xxunk - and - xxunk , xxunk paint and xxunk walls . xxmaj unfortunately , xxmaj sollett 's constant use of close - ups and one particularly bad shot with a xxunk - in on one scene come off as totally amateurish . xxmaj but xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is only xxmaj sollett 's second film , and his most well known , a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films . xxmaj one review i read xxunk the movie as , ` ethnicity for xxmaj ethnicity 's xxmaj sake , ' and i can not agree more . xxmaj if xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas were truly a great film and story , then the characters ' xxunk would n't matter whether they were xxmaj latino , xxmaj chinese , etc . xxmaj yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middle - class xxunk with a bunch of xxunk - xxunk white kids the results would n't be such glowing reviews , and we 'd see the film 's flaws more clearly . xxmaj indeed , some other aspects of the use of xxmaj latinos in this film bother me . xxmaj while some aspects of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas are accurate others i have to question . xxmaj for example , xxmaj victor , xxmaj nino and xxmaj vicky all share the same room to sleep . xxmaj this set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what i believe . xxmaj any self - xxunk xxmaj latino family would n't have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteen - year old girl . xxmaj at first i was xxunk , perhaps i was wrong , but after speaking with my grandmother i knew my problem with this was justified . xxmaj considering how conservative the grandmother is , you 'd think that xxmaj vicky would have been sleeping in her room . \n\n xxmaj as a xxmaj latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative xxmaj cuban household , raised by my grandmother while my mother was working full - time , i could relate to the movie in many ways , which is why my critical xxunk are xxunk because i really wanted to love this movie . xxmaj unfortunately , my lack of respect for xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas xxunk my feelings for the film . xxmaj maybe it 's because xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while i was playing with my xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk when i was xxunk . xxmaj maybe it 's because without any further xxunk by the film , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is merely a stereotypical hot - blooded xxmaj latino , who 'll just end up shouting to girls from his car , ` hey bay - xxunk , xxunk want to get into my xxunk xxunk - xxunk ? ' xxmaj either way i do n't like him , so ultimately how can i like a film about him ? xxmaj so if you 'll excuse me , xxmaj i 'm going to go stick my hands into a bowl of xxunk .</td>

      <td>xxbos xxmaj this film sat on my xxmaj xxunk for weeks before i watched it . i xxunk a self - indulgent xxunk flick about relationships gone bad . i was wrong ; this was an xxunk xxunk into the screwed - up xxunk of xxmaj new xxmaj xxunk . \n\n xxmaj the format is the same as xxmaj max xxmaj xxunk ' " la xxmaj xxunk , " based on a play by xxmaj arthur xxmaj xxunk , who is given an " inspired by " credit . xxmaj it starts from one person , a prostitute , standing on a street corner in xxmaj brooklyn . xxmaj she is picked up by a home contractor , who has sex with her on the hood of a car , but ca n't come . xxmaj he refuses to pay her . xxmaj when he 's off xxunk , she answers his cell phone and takes a message . xxmaj she runs away with his keys . \n\n xxmaj then the story switches to the contractor , who pays a professional call on a rich , bored xxmaj new xxmaj york woman , who plays with him until he is xxunk , then she pulls away . xxmaj she tells him how desperate and unhappy she is ; he tells her how beautiful she is , and lucky . xxmaj as he is leaving , she asks if he would have sex with her . xxmaj she sits on top of him , xxunk up and down . xxmaj this time he comes , the he leaves . \n\n xxmaj the woman and her husband throw a dinner party for their xxunk friends . xxmaj xxunk ( robert ) is talking business , wife ( ellen ) is bored , and switches the subject to sex , and how often men and women think about it . xxmaj husband switches conversation to desert . xxmaj later , after the xxunk leave , xxmaj ellen tries to entice xxmaj robert into sex . xxmaj robert wants none of it , and puts on a jazz record . xxmaj ellen turns on the radio ; xxmaj robert turns up the music ; xxmaj ellen turns on the xxup tv ; xxmaj robert turns on another xxup tv . xxmaj xxunk ensues . xxmaj ellen goes up on the roof , xxmaj robert joins her . xxmaj ellen confesses that she needs to experience more men , men other than xxmaj robert . xxmaj robert says that he too needs to experience men . \n\n xxmaj we next follow xxmaj robert as he visits an artist , xxmaj martin , played by xxmaj steve xxmaj buscemi . i wish xxmaj buscemi could have more roles like this , where he is a sexy , smart , totally xxunk guy . xxmaj robert xxunk xxmaj martin 's work , much more than it deserves , xxunk to get it into a show . xxmaj martin is excited , until it turns out that xxmaj robert is speaking out of his xxunk , it is all a xxunk dance . xxmaj robert tries to kiss xxmaj martin , on the lips , and xxmaj martin pulls back , saying that he is not gay . xxmaj robert xxunk that he 's not gay either , xxmaj martin xxunk . xxmaj both admit that the xxunk are bad . xxmaj robert is about to leave , when xxmaj martin allows xxmaj robert to kiss him . xxmaj they make out , and xxmaj robert goes down on xxmaj martin . \n\n xxmaj next we follow xxmaj martin , as he xxunk for an art show at a xxmaj manhattan gallery . xxmaj he is xxunk by the xxunk , xxmaj anna , played by xxmaj rosario xxmaj dawson . ( i had to cut some of this review to keep it under 1 xxrep 3 0 words ) â€¦ and they make love to each other . \n\n xxmaj we next follow xxmaj anna , who is sitting at a lunch stand . xxmaj her boyfriend , xxmaj nick ( adrian xxmaj xxunk ) , enters , bearing xxunk . xxmaj she is cold toward him ; he tries to figure out why . xxmaj he coaxes out of her the information that she has had sex with someone while he was in xxmaj san xxmaj francisco . xxmaj she coaxes out of him the fact that he has stayed with his ex - xxunk while in xxmaj san xxmaj francisco , and had sex with her . xxmaj the latter revelation turns out to be a lie . xxmaj the two of them make out in the xxunk , but she decides that they must break up . xxmaj nick is xxunk . \n\n xxmaj and we follow xxmaj nick , who confesses his xxunk to an older woman who he meets on a park bench , xxmaj joey ( carol xxmaj kane ) . xxmaj joey is sort of weird and child - like , but is a good audience for xxmaj nick , who needs a sympathetic ear . xxmaj the two of them go to xxmaj xxunk xxmaj island at night , and look at the stars . xxmaj nick falls under xxmaj joey 's spell , despite the age difference between them . xxmaj they go back to xxmaj joey 's apartment , and xxmaj nick gradually realizes that he is about to have sex with a crazy old woman . xxmaj she is on top of him , does n't want to let him go . xxmaj but he manages to escape . \n\n ( this is , by the way , the best xxmaj carol xxmaj kane role since she played xxmaj xxunk 's wife in xxmaj taxi . ) xxmaj joey 's phone rings , and it is a man calling the xxmaj psychic xxmaj friends xxmaj network , and xxmaj joey is one of the psychic friends . xxmaj although she is still hurting from xxmaj nick , she gradually gets into her psychic xxunk . xxmaj the man is at his office , late at night , and wants to have phone sex with her . xxmaj although that is not xxmaj joey 's business , xxmaj joey goes along , and coaxes the man to come . xxmaj she wants to keep talking , although the man want to get off the phone , and finds out that he has xxunk a lot of money from his company , and will be found out xxunk . xxmaj his life is ruined . xxmaj joey realizes that the man is going to commit suicide , and she tries to make him believe that she is his friend , that she cares about him . xxmaj and she does care about him . \n\n xxmaj but the man packs a gun into his xxunk , and goes off to seek a prostitute on the xxmaj brooklyn xxunk , and we come back to the beginning , to the same prostitute who started out xxmaj la xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj she wants to give him $ xxunk , xxrep 3 0 in cash if she will kill him . xxmaj he tried to kill himself , but could n't do it . xxmaj the prostitute does not want to do it , but he insists , holding her hand , holding the gun inside his mouth , telling her where to aim . xxmaj eventually , the gun goes off , and we see the prostitute walking down the street , and xxunk at the corner where she normally does business . xxmaj the contractor who did n't pay her earlier in the movie drives up , xxunk down the window . xxmaj they look at each other . xxup the xxup end .</td>

      <td>xxbos xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas : a xxmaj review \n\n xxmaj you know , xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is like sticking your hands into a big , xxunk bowl of xxunk . xxmaj it 's warm and gooey , but you 're not sure if it feels right . xxmaj try as i might , no matter how warm and gooey xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas became i was always aware that something did n't quite feel right . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas suffers from a certain xxunk on the director 's part . xxmaj apparently , the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a xxmaj latino family on the lower east side , and an xxunk storyline would make the film critic proof . xxmaj he was right , but it did n't fool me . xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is the story about a xxunk - year old boy called , you guessed it , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas ( victor xxmaj xxunk ) who lives his teenage years chasing more xxunk than the xxmaj rolling xxmaj xxunk could do in all the years they 've xxunk . xxmaj the movie starts off in ` ugly xxmaj fat ' xxmaj donna 's bedroom where xxmaj victor is sure to seduce her , but a cry from outside xxunk his plans when his best - friend xxmaj harold ( kevin xxmaj xxunk ) comes - a - looking for him . xxmaj caught in the attempt by xxmaj harold and his sister , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas runs off for xxunk control . xxmaj yet even with the embarrassing implication that he 's been xxunk the xxunk girl in the neighborhood , nothing xxunk young xxmaj victor from going off on the hunt for more fresh meat . xxmaj on a hot , xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj city day they make way to the local public swimming pool where xxmaj victor 's eyes catch a glimpse of the lovely young xxunk xxmaj judy ( judy xxmaj xxunk ) , who 's not just pretty , but a strong and independent too . xxmaj the relationship that develops between xxmaj victor and xxmaj judy becomes the focus of the film . xxmaj the story also focuses on xxmaj victor 's family that is comprised of his grandmother or xxunk ( xxunk xxmaj guzman ) , his brother xxmaj nino ( also played by real life brother to xxmaj victor , xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) and his sister xxmaj vicky ( xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) . xxmaj the action follows xxmaj victor between scenes with xxmaj judy and scenes with his family . xxmaj victor tries to xxunk with being an oversexed pimp - daddy , his feelings for xxmaj judy and his grandmother 's conservative xxmaj catholic upbringing . \n\n xxmaj the problems that xxunk from xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas are a few , but glaring errors . xxmaj throughout the film you get to know certain characters like xxmaj vicky , xxmaj nino , xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj judy and even xxmaj judy 's best friend xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj the problem is , we know nothing of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas except that he is the biggest gigolo in the neighborhood . xxmaj we know that he knows how to lick his lips , and xxunk his xxunk , and carry himself for the sake of xxunk girls into the xxunk , but that 's all . xxmaj we know that xxmaj nino plays piano , and quiet well , you could see it by the awards on the family piano . xxmaj we know his sister xxmaj xxunk , is a gossip - loving girl with an xxunk interest in watching xxup tv . xxmaj we know that xxunk is a hard - working traditional xxmaj xxunk woman who 's trying to raise her kids with xxunk in a world of excess corruption . xxmaj yet where is the titular character , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas ? xxmaj he 's in this movie somewhere , but we only know what the movie tells us . xxmaj this is by far the film 's biggest flaw . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is n't so much a character but a xxunk - xxunk ball , xxunk between scenes with xxmaj judy and his xxmaj grandmother , but we never get to know who xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas really is . xxmaj this is important because as xxmaj i 've mentioned the only thing we know of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is that he 's a sexually active teenager with a xxunk the size of xxmaj manhattan . xxmaj he 's a total xxmaj xxunk - male . xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is not the kind of character i sympathize with at all . xxmaj why should anyone ? xxmaj so by the end of the movie , in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas has attained xxup any depth and learned the errors of his ways ? xxmaj how could such a two - dimensional character have any depth ? xxmaj if only the director had worried a little more about xxunk out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect hand - held shot . \n\n xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas brings to life the world of the xxmaj latino inner - city neighborhood to the big screen . xxmaj something that few films have done before in the past . xxmaj the film has been xxunk for feeling so real , and i wo n't \n\n argue with that . i have n't seen this level of reality since xxup xxunk aired xxmaj survivor . xxmaj seriously , although the movie has some nice shots of the city , the writer / director xxmaj peter xxmaj sollett was way too xxunk on close - ups and hand - held shots . xxmaj this problem is particularly noticed in xxunk scenes that are so claustrophobic i was forced to perform deep - breathing xxunk to keep from passing out . xxmaj as the film continues , the shots get tighter and tighter with faces xxunk from xxunk to xxunk on the screen ; you can practically xxunk xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas 's cheap xxunk . xxmaj the overall effect is unrealistic in contrast . xxmaj the xxunk scenes of inner - city apartments make them look small and xxunk , which is not true . xxmaj i 've been in those type apartments ; i used to live in one . xxmaj they 're not xxunk but they have high xxunk and they 're decent living xxunk . xxmaj by the movie 's standards you 'd think that these apartments were xxunk xxunk of xxunk - and - xxunk , xxunk paint and xxunk walls . xxmaj unfortunately , xxmaj sollett 's constant use of close - ups and one particularly bad shot with a xxunk - in on one scene come off as totally amateurish . xxmaj but xxmaj raising xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is only xxmaj sollett 's second film , and his most well known , a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films . xxmaj one review i read xxunk the movie as , ` ethnicity for xxmaj ethnicity 's xxmaj sake , ' and i can not agree more . xxmaj if xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas were truly a great film and story , then the characters ' xxunk would n't matter whether they were xxmaj latino , xxmaj chinese , etc . xxmaj yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middle - class xxunk with a bunch of xxunk - xxunk white kids the results would n't be such glowing reviews , and we 'd see the film 's flaws more clearly . xxmaj indeed , some other aspects of the use of xxmaj latinos in this film bother me . xxmaj while some aspects of xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas are accurate others i have to question . xxmaj for example , xxmaj victor , xxmaj nino and xxmaj vicky all share the same room to sleep . xxmaj this set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what i believe . xxmaj any self - xxunk xxmaj latino family would n't have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteen - year old girl . xxmaj at first i was xxunk , perhaps i was wrong , but after speaking with my grandmother i knew my problem with this was justified . xxmaj considering how conservative the grandmother is , you 'd think that xxmaj vicky would have been sleeping in her room . \n\n xxmaj as a xxmaj latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative xxmaj cuban household , raised by my grandmother while my mother was working full - time , i could relate to the movie in many ways , which is why my critical xxunk are xxunk because i really wanted to love this movie . xxmaj unfortunately , my lack of respect for xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas xxunk my feelings for the film . xxmaj maybe it 's because xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while i was playing with my xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk when i was xxunk . xxmaj maybe it 's because without any further xxunk by the film , xxmaj victor xxmaj vargas is merely a stereotypical hot - blooded xxmaj latino , who 'll just end up shouting to girls from his car , ` hey bay - xxunk , xxunk want to get into my xxunk xxunk - xxunk ? ' xxmaj either way i do n't like him , so ultimately how can i like a film about him ? xxmaj so if you 'll excuse me , xxmaj i 'm going to go stick my hands into a bowl of xxunk .</td>

( i had to cut some of this review to keep it under 1 xxrep 3 0 words ) â€¦ and they make love to each other . \n\n xxmaj we next follow xxmaj anna , who is sitting at a lunch stand . xxmaj her boyfriend , xxmaj nick ( adrian xxmaj xxunk ) , enters , bearing xxunk . xxmaj she is cold toward him ; he tries to figure out why . xxmaj he coaxes out of her the information that she has had sex with someone while he was in xxmaj san xxmaj francisco . xxmaj she coaxes out of him the fact that he has stayed with his ex - xxunk while in xxmaj san xxmaj francisco , and had sex with her . xxmaj the latter revelation turns out to be a lie . xxmaj the two of them make out in the xxunk , but she decides that they must break up . xxmaj nick is xxunk . \n\n xxmaj and we follow xxmaj nick , who confesses his xxunk to an older woman who he meets on a park bench , xxmaj joey ( carol xxmaj kane ) . xxmaj joey is sort of weird and child - like , but is a good audience for xxmaj nick , who needs a sympathetic ear . xxmaj the two of them go to xxmaj xxunk xxmaj island at night , and look at the stars . xxmaj nick falls under xxmaj joey 's spell , despite the age difference between them . xxmaj they go back to xxmaj joey 's apartment , and xxmaj nick gradually realizes that he is about to have sex with a crazy old woman . xxmaj she is on top of him , does n't want to let him go . xxmaj but he manages to escape . \n\n ( this is , by the way , the best xxmaj carol xxmaj kane role since she played xxmaj xxunk 's wife in xxmaj taxi . ) xxmaj joey 's phone rings , and it is a man calling the xxmaj psychic xxmaj friends xxmaj network , and xxmaj joey is one of the psychic friends . xxmaj although she is still hurting from xxmaj nick , she gradually gets into her psychic xxunk . xxmaj the man is at his office , late at night , and wants to have phone sex with her . xxmaj although that is not xxmaj joey 's business , xxmaj joey goes along , and coaxes the man to come . xxmaj she wants to keep talking , although the man want to get off the phone , and finds out that he has xxunk a lot of money from his company , and will be found out xxunk . xxmaj his life is ruined . xxmaj joey realizes that the man is going to commit suicide , and she tries to make him believe that she is his friend , that she cares about him . xxmaj and she does care about him . \n\n xxmaj but the man packs a gun into his xxunk , and goes off to seek a prostitute on the xxmaj brooklyn xxunk , and we come back to the beginning , to the same prostitute who started out xxmaj la xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj she wants to give him $ xxunk , xxrep 3 0 in cash if she will kill him . xxmaj he tried to kill himself , but could n't do it . xxmaj the prostitute does not want to do it , but he insists , holding her hand , holding the gun inside his mouth , telling her where to aim . xxmaj eventually , the gun goes off , and we see the prostitute walking down the street , and xxunk at the corner where she normally does business . xxmaj the contractor who did n't pay her earlier in the movie drives up , xxunk down the window . xxmaj they look at each other . xxup the xxup end .</td>

" xxmaj his science teacher at xxmaj big xxmaj xxunk xxmaj high xxmaj school , xxmaj miss xxmaj xxunk xxmaj riley ( laura xxmaj xxunk ) greatly supports xxmaj homer , and the four boys work on building rockets in xxmaj homer 's basement . xxmaj his father , however , whose life is the mine , does not support him . xxmaj john xxmaj hickam ( chris xxmaj cooper ) believes that xxmaj homer should n't waste his time on the rockets , that the coal mines are all that matter . xxmaj the coal from the mines is used to make steel , and without steel , the country would be nothing . xxmaj the difficult relationship between xxmaj homer and his dad is one of the most poignant relationships i have ever seen in a film . xxmaj miss xxmaj riley introduces xxmaj homer to the idea of entering the local science fair , with a chance to go the xxunk and win a college scholarship . " you ca n't just dream your way out of xxmaj coalwood , " she tells xxmaj homer . xxmaj homer and his friends act upon their dreams by working constantly on the rockets , xxunk the models with each attempt . xxmaj despite the many attempts , the boys do not lose their determination . " what are the chances of us winning that science fair , " o'dell asks xxmaj homer in one of their more xxunk moments . " a million to one , " answers xxmaj homer . " that good ? " o'dell replies , " well , why did n't you say so ? " xxmaj the music , composed by xxmaj mark xxmaj xxunk , conveys sadness and hope at the same time , especially sad at a point when xxmaj homer xxunk into the mine xxunk and loses sight of the sky and his dreams of getting out of xxmaj coalwood . xxmaj xxunk 1950s ' rock and roll , including songs by xxmaj the xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj buddy xxmaj xxunk , occasionally pushes the xxunk pieces aside to create a light - hearted mood that xxunk the teenagers ' lives with the lives of the miners . xxmaj the film , photographed by xxmaj fred xxmaj murphy , also uses colors to set xxunk and xxunk . xxmaj the town of xxmaj coalwood , actually filmed in xxmaj xxunk , is washed with blues , xxunk , and xxunk . xxmaj it 's as if the xxunk from the coal sticks to xxunk faces , clothes , houses , and roads . xxmaj when a couple in a xxunk red convertible stops to ask for directions from the boys , it is obvious that they are from the world outside of xxmaj coalwood and the xxmaj olga xxmaj coal xxmaj company . xxmaj the book on xxunk xxunk design that xxmaj miss xxmaj riley gives xxmaj homer is red . xxmaj the red stands out enough against the blue - gray world of xxmaj coalwood to xxunk " getting out " , but it is still subtle . xxmaj the xxunk are xxunk hints of a world that xxmaj homer only dreams of . xxmaj jake xxmaj xxunk xxunk such xxunk , hope , and xxunk as xxmaj homer xxmaj hickam that it is hard to believe he is n't the real xxmaj homer we see in actual footage at the end of the film . xxmaj chris xxmaj cooper is also xxunk believable as xxmaj homer 's xxunk father , who does n't recognize , or just does n't want to admit , that the mine is not producing enough to keep the town alive . xxmaj homer , and everyone who encourages him in his rocket - building , is aware that the town is dying . xxmaj with the community xxunk , the only way they stay together is by gathering for the rocket boys ' xxunk . xxmaj again , xxmaj i 'm sure things did n't happen exactly as the movie portrayed them , but what would a movie be without a bit of xxunk ? " october xxmaj sky " has just enough of that to make it a great motion picture and enough xxunk to keep it real .</td>

      <td>xxbos xxmaj to review this movie , i without any doubt would have to quote that memorable scene in xxmaj tarantino 's " pulp xxmaj fiction " ( xxunk ) when xxmaj jules and xxmaj vincent are talking about xxmaj mia xxmaj wallace and what she does for a living . xxmaj jules tells xxmaj vincent that the " only thing she did worthwhile was pilot " . xxmaj vincent asks " what the hell is a pilot ? " and xxmaj jules goes into a very well description of what a xxup tv pilot is : " well , the way they make shows is , they make one show . xxmaj that show 's called a ' pilot ' . xxmaj then they show that show to the people who make shows , and on the strength of that one show they decide if they 're going to make more shows . xxmaj some pilots get picked and become television programs . xxmaj some do n't , become nothing . xxmaj she starred in one of the ones that became nothing . " xxmaj now to stretch on what xxmaj jules was talking about , there are xxup billions of television shows / pilots that were never aired because they simply were not â€¦ well , good . xxmaj probably the most notorious pilot that comes to mind is " xxunk " , a spin - off to " xxunk " with xxmaj gary " radar " xxmaj xxunk as the lead . h xxrep 3 m , would somebody really want to be watching xxmaj radar for a half - hour trying to solve crimes ? xxmaj hence , the show was never picked up . xxmaj what many people do n't know ( or what they thought they knew ) is that pilots are hardly ever shown on the air , for they are made strictly for the xxmaj television xxunk for them to decide . xxmaj some have made they 're way past and got onto the air ( the pilot for the animated series " american xxmaj dad " comes to mind , as the show 's serial itself did n't begin until nearly four months later . xxmaj however , there are times were we should all be glad pilots never make it to air , and this here is why . \n\n " black xxmaj bart " , a supposed tie - in with the xxmaj mel xxmaj brooks comedy classic , " blazing xxmaj saddles " , is a stale and bland " sitcom " with little heart and no soul . " saddles " was a controversial comedy , nevertheless , with it 's racist humor and vulgar comedy , which comes to mind " what idiot decided this would make a great television show xxup for xxup prime xxup time xxup tv ? ! ? " i say " supposed " , because none of the memorable characters from the movie , aside from xxmaj bart , on in this mess of a xxup tv show . xxmaj mel xxmaj brooks was n't even involved with the production of the serial and this was the first mistake in a long line ( in a related story , i recently found out about an xxunk xxup tv pilot for a series based on the movie " xxunk . " that xxmaj kevin xxmaj smith was no involved in â€¦ xxunk see what happens ? ! ? ) . \n\n xxmaj set somewhere around the same time as the movie ( or at all ) , the story circles around the only xxmaj black sheriff in the wild west , named appropriately ' black ' xxmaj bart , who is this time played by future xxmaj academy xxmaj award winner xxmaj louis xxmaj xxunk xxmaj jr . , obviously before his xxunk in " real " acting , whereas in this he is playing a " g - rated " xxmaj richard xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj most of the other characters are carbon ( if not , really bad ) copies of the characters in the movie : xxmaj jim , xxmaj the xxmaj xxunk xxmaj kid is replaced by a similar looking character named xxmaj reb xxmaj xxunk , a former xxmaj confederate soldier who is quick with the gun . xxmaj xxunk xxmaj von xxmaj xxunk is now xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk , a more of a xxunk of the character being that she 's a show dancer and a xxmaj german with a xxmaj marlene xxmaj dietrich - type accent and personality . xxmaj while that 's pretty much the end in similarities , xxmaj the lead " bad guy " in the story is xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk , played by xxmaj noble xxmaj xxunk , who i assumed would 've been xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk if xxmaj warner xxmaj xxunk . xxunk the rights to the name ( see trivia for " blazing xxmaj saddles " ) and his son xxmaj xxunk â€¦ i xxunk , xxmaj xxunk i suppose ? xxmaj the story is a poor excuse for a sitcom , much less a pilot . xxmaj bart deals with the mayor 's drunk son and he 's out - of - control behavior which has caused the town to spin . xxmaj really , it 's a story that tries to xxunk all the characters in the " series " and does n't focus on the variety and context that would make this an " alright " show . i ca n't really call it a sitcom ( and even if i wanted to ) and that 's primarily the fact it was shot on the xxunk at xxmaj warner xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj studios and later added a laugh track , so the show is set up almost exactly like " xxunk " ( complete with a bland and dull " laughing " that is identical to the series ) . xxmaj the acting is so - so , but there 's one part that always make me laugh , and that 's when the actor playing xxmaj reb xxmaj xxunk almost seems to forget his lines and tries really hard to remember them while trying to xxunk out a piece of dialogue . xxup ha ! xxmaj the script is rather dull and is attempts to make racism more humorous than it was in the movie ( surprisingly , they use the word " n xxrep 3 * xxunk " numerous amount of times through a xxunk episode , rather xxunk for it 's time period and even for today ) and it gets repetitive . \n\n xxmaj if you ever get your hands on this xxunk piece of xxrep 5 s â€¦ xxunk interesting xxunk item , watch it just for the sake of the feeling for watching pilots ( it 's on the xxunk 's edition of " blazing xxmaj saddles " , xxmaj god knows why ) . xxmaj there , yourself get a first hand chance for the reason why many movie tie - in pilots never air .</td>
